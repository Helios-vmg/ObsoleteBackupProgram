filter() and filter_unencrypted() are invertible functions that map binary strings to binary strings. filter() may involve an encryption step, but filter_unencrypted() does not. It is not possible to seek on x by seeking on filter(x) or filter_unencrypted(x), therefore when unfiltering filter(x), x can only be read from beggining to end.

file_data, rdiff_data, and fso_data each consists of binary strings concatenated without padding. The length of each binary string is stored in a table elsewhere.
Each string in file_data contains a whole file or an rdiff data block.
Each string in rdiff_data contains an rdiff program associated with an rdiff data block. The association is stored elsewhere.
Each string in fso_data contains a serialized FileSystemObject.

manifest contains pos1, pos2, pos3, and the lengths of every binary string in file_data, rdiff_data, and fso_data.

length contains the difference between pos4 and pos3 (i.e. the length of filter_unencrypted(manifest)) stored as a fixed length 64-bit integer. Archive reading will begin here.

sha256 contains the SHA-256 digest of the data from /*begin SHA-256*/ to /*end SHA-256*/.
